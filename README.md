# Snoop, the Dog Breed Identifier

I trained this [Dog Breed Identification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C7FztAFZFaeyF3xz6vR2C5_WduWecvqV/view?usp=drive_link) machine learning model as part of the [Complete Machine Learning and Data Science](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp/) course from [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/), taught by [Daniel Bourke](https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/daniel-bourke/) and [Andrei Neagoie](https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/andrei-neagoie/).
